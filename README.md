# Market Making Simulator

Simulate a market


## Needs to do
- Finish prototype (get server to work and hook shitty python frontend to the flask server)
- Migrate to java backend (use nodejs if this doesnt work)
- Make a pretty frontend, ideas include, graphs for bid ask spread, requires fields and buttons for placing order, nice way to present active orders and orderbook
- Use algorithms to make backend fast (heaps for orderbook, some other ideas later on) 

## Future Ideas
- Make a database to hold the logs
- Trading bots (make hitter and quoter bots)
- Make an automatic market (randomly generate orders based on some probability distribution scheme)
- Make it more robust in terms of security
- Make backend super fast? (using threads? idk)
