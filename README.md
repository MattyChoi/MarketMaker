# Market Making Simulator

Simulate a market


## Needs to do
- Make a pretty frontend (using React now), ideas include, graphs for bid ask spread, requires fields and buttons for placing order, nice way to present active orders and orderbook, make pop ups for delete order buttons and possibly order button
- Use algorithms to make backend fast (heaps for orderbook, some other ideas later on) 
- Use Firebase to authenticate users to make sure other users can place orders using other users accounts

## Future Ideas
- Make a database to hold the logs
- Trading bots (make hitter and quoter bots)
- Make an automatic market (randomly generate orders based on some probability distribution scheme)
- Make it more robust in terms of security
- Make backend super fast? (using threads? idk)
